# paycertify-hot-100

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Elias and Matheus.

I had fun doing the project. It is deployed to the web at this url: [https://paycertify-hot-100.firebaseapp.com/](https://paycertify-hot-100.firebaseapp.com/)

I did not have a lot of time this week. It is Valentine's Day here in the states, but I did he best I could with the time I had. I wish I had gotten to more testing... but don't we always.

If you have any questions please reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Levi
